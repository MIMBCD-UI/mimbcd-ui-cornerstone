[MIMBCD-UI](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) is a Research Project that deals with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). These deep networks will incorporate information from several different modes by a User Interface (UI) implemented using the [Cornerstone Library](https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone). The [Cornerstone](https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone) is an Open Source Project with a goal to deliver a complete web based medical imaging platform.
